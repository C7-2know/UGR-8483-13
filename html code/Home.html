                    <q>Mekedonia is the place that every one could understand what the meaning of life is. 
                        it shows other side of life. it will calm you from running only for what you don't have,
                         it gives you an impression of "yes i even could help some one!".

                    <q>This is the closest I have come to experiencing a Mother Theresa like home.
                        The stories of Before and After are bone chilling. Mekedonia welcomes people 
                        in desperate need with an open heart, to share God's love together as a family.

                    <q>You wouldn't get into trouble for giving to peoples and also You wouldn't lose because you share with peoples. Try to live 
                        simply because we don't have much time to live in in this world. Try to be happy with what you have and help peoples to get 
                    their basic needs</q>
